                              Did you know that?
                              I
                              frequently have my doubts. I don't. Not any more. And maybe in a thousand years or
                              so,
                              we'll be able
                              to prove it. To all mankind -- may we never find space so vast, planets so cold,
                              heart and
                              mind so
                              empty that we cannot fill them with love and warmth. It's time you learned that
                              freedom is
                              never a
                              gift. It has to be earned.
