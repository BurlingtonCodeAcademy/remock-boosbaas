                        <h2>Lake Monster Uses Model Airplane To Explore The Final Frontier</h2>
                        <img class="logo" id=#topImage src="remockBox.svg">
                        <p>These are the voyages of Champy. My continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no lake monster has gone before. 
                              <br /><br />
                              Captains's Log: Stardate: 12.42.33. <br />I have stolen a model airplane and modified it for my own use.
                              <br /><br />
                              Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According to coordinates, we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located near the system J-25. Tractor beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report? Sections 27, 28 and 29 on decks four, five and six destroyed. Without our shields, at this range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.
                              <br /><br />
                              We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.
                              <br /><br />
                              Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by 3,000 percent. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What is the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period would make this a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation?
                              <br /><br />
                                                            It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem,  the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with phase discriminators.
                              <br /><br />
                              We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.
                              <br /><br />
                              Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.
                              <br /><br />
                              Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust shield harmonics to the upper EM band when proceeding. These appear to be some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions. Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band.
                              <br /><br />
                              Resistance is futile.<br>

                        Did you know that?
                        I
                        frequently have my doubts. I don't. Not any more. And maybe in a thousand years or so,
                        we'll be able
                        to prove it. To all mankind -- may we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and
                        mind so
                        empty that we cannot fill them with love and warmth. It's time you learned that freedom is
                        never a
                        gift. It has to be earned.</div>
