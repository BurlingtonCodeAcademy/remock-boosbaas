                              <p>These are the voyages of Champy. My continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds,
                                    to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no lake monster has
                                    gone before.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Captains's Log: Stardate: 12.42.33. <br />I have stolen a model airplane and
                                    modified it for my own use.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According to coordinates,
                                    we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located near the system J-25. Tractor
                                    beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report?
                                    Sections 27, 28 and 29 on decks four, five and six destroyed. Without our shields,
                                    at this range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control,
                                    gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. Sensors show energy
                                    readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil.
                                    Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation
                                    levels in our atmosphere have increased by 3,000 percent. Electromagnetic and
                                    subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What is the strength of the ship's
                                    deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period would make
                                    this a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic
                                    simulation?
                                    <br /><br />
                                    It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The
                                    cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem, the entire nervous system has been
                                    depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that would produce high levels
                                    of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular
                                    polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field.
                                    We could alter the photons with phase discriminators.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of
                                    bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the EM spectrum ranging from heat
                                    and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said and
                                    listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance
                                    of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar
                                    flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar
                                    006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total
                                    guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield
                                    effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical
                                    pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core
                                    primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Resistance is
                                    futile. Recommend we adjust shield harmonics to the upper EM band when proceeding.
                                    These appear to be some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work
                                    collectively as they perform ship functions. Increase deflector modulation to upper
                                    frequency band.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Resistance is futile.<br>

                        I
                        frequently have my doubts. I don't. Not any more. And maybe in a thousand years or

                        we'll be able

                        mind so
