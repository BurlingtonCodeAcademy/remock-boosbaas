      <h2>Structural Dynamics in Aeronautical Engineering</h2>
      <img id="topImage" src="remockBox.svg">

      <p>is a comprehensive introduction to the modern methods of dynamic analysis of aeronautical structures. The
        text is particularly suitable for undergraduate students. For advanced students, the text provides numerous
        references on seminal work on structural dynamics that can be used for
        graduate-level research.The text represents carefully developed course materials, beginning with an
        introductory chapter on matrix algebra and methods for numerical computations, followed by a series of chapters
        discussing
        specific aeronautical applications.<br>
        In this way, the student can be guided from the simple concept of a single-degree-of-freedom
        structural system to the more complex multidegree-of-freedom and continuous systems, including random
        vibrations, nonlinear systems, and aeroelastic phenomena. Among the various examples used in the text, the
        chapter on aeroelasticity of flight vehicles is particularly noteworthy with its clear presentation of the
        phenomena and
        its mathematical formulation for structural and aerodynamic loads.</br>

      <h2>more jargon</h2>
      <p>A fixed grid representation of the finite element domain is used to solve elasticity problems. An integration
        between CAD and FEM systems is made by using this fixed grid representation. Some considerations about FG
        approximation and stiffness matrix generation are presented. The element stiffness matrix for an element in
        the mesh is obtained as a factor of a standard element stiffness matrix. A least squares local approximation of
        stress field is used to calculate the stress at boundary elements. A problem with an analytical solution is used
        to measure the
        displacement and stress error. Several meshes and several geometrical configurations of the problem are used to
        test the reliability of the fixed grid finite element method.
