    <p>the visualization of sea-serpents from early mythology, through the sixteenth-century “HIC SVNT DRACONES” (“here are
    dragons”) maps, into the modern age. And as would be expected, included therein were many illustrations, some by artists
    of renown such as Gutave Doré, of fantastical creatures seemingly ripped from the pages of novels by Edgar Rice
    Burroughs or Jules Verne. Amidst these representations of menacing monsters locked in battle with tall ships or
    threatening shore-bound onlookers was a small, apparently innocuous drawing (Figure 1). Unattributed to any specific
    sighting, it was placed at the bottom of a page in the chapter “1850 to 1900” (Sweeney 1972: 88) and seems to be related
    to a proximal paragraph of text about sea-serpents in the nineteenth century, being given the scientific name Lineus
    longissimus, which is actually that for the Bootlace Worm, and which at over 50 metres, is the longest animal known. The
    reason suggested by Sweeney (1972: 87–88) for this adopted nomenclature is thought to have been science's attempt to
    “apply this catchall term in order to purge itself of any association with illusion.” I became interested in determining
    the source of this particular sketch, which, given its amateurish penmanship, I assumed to have been made by an
    eyewitness to the actual sighting, for the very reason that it was so remarkably incongruous to the other,
    professionally rendered illustrations of overwrought artistic imagination that subsumed the rest of the book.
